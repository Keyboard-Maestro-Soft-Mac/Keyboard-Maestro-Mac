## 🧩 Overview  

Keyboard Maestro for macOS is a leading automation utility that allows users to streamline repetitive tasks, enhance productivity, and take full control of their workflows. Whether you’re managing applications, typing repetitive text, or performing complex system operations, Keyboard Maestro turns routine actions into customizable, automatic sequences known as macros.  

At its core, the app enables you to create and manage powerful automation workflows without any coding experience. Each macro can be triggered by keyboard shortcuts, typed strings, specific applications, system events, or even connected devices. The visual macro editor makes it easy to design, modify, and organize automations to suit your exact workflow preferences.  

Keyboard Maestro integrates deeply with macOS and your favorite apps, allowing automation of almost any activity — from launching applications and managing windows to executing scripts and controlling clipboard content. You can also set up macros that perform multiple actions in a sequence, transforming tedious processes into a single keystroke.  

The app also includes a wide range of features for advanced users: variables, loops, conditionals, and AppleScript support make it capable of handling both simple and highly sophisticated automation tasks. The built-in Clipboard History Switcher and Application Switcher extend macOS capabilities far beyond the system defaults.  

Optimized for Apple Silicon, Keyboard Maestro provides instant performance and reliability even with hundreds of active macros. Whether you’re a developer, writer, editor, or power user, this tool helps you save time, eliminate repetitive effort, and achieve smoother, smarter workflows across macOS.
